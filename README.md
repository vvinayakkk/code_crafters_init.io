## Overview

Welcome to the **Autonomous Surveillance System**, an innovative AIML-driven solution that redefines security through advanced data fusion of heterogeneous sensor inputsâ€”camera feeds, laser scanners, buried optic fibers, underground sensors (UGS), and weather data. Designed to tackle the challenges of **intrusion detection**, **event tracking**, **anomaly detection**, and **real-time alerting**, this project integrates state-of-the-art computer vision, time-series modeling, and intelligent agent systems to deliver unparalleled situational awareness.

Our system processes:
1. **Video Feeds**: Semantic segmentation and hybrid transformer-based classification for threat detection.
2. **Raw Sensor Data**: Ensemble learning with hierarchical sub-categorization for precise anomaly detection.
3. **Weather Data**: Multi-level predictive modeling for environmental context.

The dashboard provides a dynamic visualization of processed data, simulating real-time CCTV feeds with detailed statistics, while an AI agent orchestrates notifications via WhatsApp, Gmail, and Google Docs, ensuring rapid response to critical events.

## Problem Statement

The goal was to create an autonomous surveillance system capable of:
- Detecting and tracking intrusions with high precision.
- Monitoring events and anomalies across diverse data streams.
- Issuing real-time alerts to authorities and stakeholders.

We introduced novelty by fusing multi-modal data into a cohesive framework, leveraging advanced segmentation techniques, transformer-based architectures, and ensemble learning to achieve exceptional accuracy and interpretability.

## Methodology and Architecture

### Video Processing Pipeline

#### Semantic Segmentation
We implemented semantic segmentation from scratch using three distinct methodologies, each optimized for robustness and precision:

1. **Background Subtraction**  
   - **Architecture**: Custom temporal differencing with adaptive Gaussian mixture models (GMM).  
   - **Methodology**: Frames are analyzed for pixel-wise changes against a dynamically updated background model. We incorporated a multi-scale approach to handle noise and illumination variations, with a shadow removal module based on chromaticity analysis.  
   - **Why?**: Ensures real-time performance while capturing subtle foreground movements.

2. **Watershed Segmentation**  
   - **Architecture**: Marker-controlled watershed with gradient-based edge detection.  
   - **Methodology**: Utilizes morphological operations to define object boundaries, followed by a flooding algorithm to segment regions. We enhanced it with a pre-processing step using Sobel filters for gradient computation and a post-processing step to merge over-segmented regions.  
   - **Why?**: Excels at separating overlapping objects, critical for crowded surveillance scenes.

3. **Mask R-CNN (Built from Scratch)**  
   - **Architecture**: A fully custom implementation with a ResNet-50 backbone, Region Proposal Network (RPN), and a mask prediction head.  
   - **Methodology**: Combines bounding box regression, classification, and pixel-wise mask generation. We optimized the RPN with anchor pruning and introduced a custom loss function blending cross-entropy and Dice loss for sharper mask boundaries.  
   - **Why?**: Provides instance-level segmentation, enabling precise object identification.

#### Classification with Swin Transformer
Post-segmentation, we employed a **Swin Transformer with Attention Mechanism and Customized Blocks** for classification:
- **Architecture**: 
  - Swin Transformer base with shifted window attention for hierarchical feature extraction.
  - Custom blocks include a **Dynamic Attention Refinement Module (DARM)** to prioritize critical regions and a **Spatio-Temporal Fusion Layer (STFL)** to integrate frame sequences.
- **Why Swin?**: Its hierarchical structure and efficient attention mechanism reduce computational complexity while capturing long-range dependencies across frames, outperforming traditional CNN-RNN hybrids.
- **Training**: 
  - Initial 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001, followed by 20 accelerated epochs using cosine annealing, achieving a **validation accuracy of 96.8%**.
  - Classes: `'Abuse', 'Arson', 'Assault', 'Burglary', 'Explosion', 'Fighting', 'Normal', 'RoadAccidents', 'Robbery', 'Shooting'`.

#### YOLOv11-OBB Fine-Tuning
- **Architecture**: Fine-tuned YOLOv11 with oriented bounding boxes (OBB) for intermediate visualization.
- **Methodology**: Adjusted the head to predict rotated boxes, enhancing detection of non-axis-aligned objects. Trained with a mix of synthetic and augmented data, achieving a **mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.45%**.
- **Why?**: Provides interpretable bounding boxes and labels, aiding model debugging and stakeholder understanding.

### Sensor Data Processing

#### Synthetic Dataset Generation
Lacking real-time IoT devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi), we generated a **synthetic dataset of 10,000 rows** based on realistic ranges sourced from online research:
- Parameters: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, pressure, solar radiation, cloud cover, dew point, vibration, noise, lidar distance, etc.
- Distribution: Modeled with statistical distributions (e.g., Gaussian for temperature, exponential for precipitation).

#### Hierarchical Ensemble Learning
- **Initial Attempt**: Random Forest yielded a dismal **22% accuracy**, prompting a rethink.
- **Solution**: Iterative Sub-Category Ensemble Approach:
  1. **Level 1**: XGBoost for coarse classification into major classes (e.g., Normal, Abnormal).
  2. **Level 2**: LightGBM for sub-categories within each major class (e.g., Power Outage, Intrusion).
  3. **Level 3**: CatBoost for fine-grained event types, leveraging categorical feature handling.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) optimized learning rates, tree depths, and regularization terms across 50 trials per model.
- **Outcome**: Achieved **99.6% accuracy** with detailed probabilistic outputs.

#### Output Interpretation
The sensor model produces a rich JSON output (e.g., Power Outage event):
- **Major Class**: Normal/Abnormal (Level 1).
- **Detailed Class**: Specific event type (e.g., Power Outage).
- **Insights**: Multi-layer metrics including raw sensor values, physical metrics (e.g., thermal energy), risk scores (e.g., flood risk), and statistical measures (e.g., kurtosis).
- **Justification**: 
  - **XGBoost**: Handles initial feature importance with gradient boosting, reducing dimensionality.
  - **LightGBM**: Accelerates training with histogram-based splits, excelling on sub-categories.
  - **CatBoost**: Manages fine-grained classification with ordered boosting, minimizing overfitting.
  - **Optuna**: Ensures optimal hyperparameters, balancing bias-variance trade-offs.

### Weather Data Processing
- **Approach**: Similar hierarchical ensemble with weather-specific features (e.g., wind chill, heat index).
- **Model**: Trained on synthetic weather data, achieving high accuracy for contextual event prediction.
- **Integration**: Fused with sensor and video outputs for comprehensive threat assessment.
